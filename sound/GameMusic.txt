I've removed all the game music due to copyright issue. (they're all from KOF)
To ensure you get the full gaming experience, 
you'll need to find three mp3 files, place them to this folder(sound folder), and rename them "HomeState.mp3", "GameState1.mp3", "GameState2.mp3", "GameState3.mp3", respectively.
Once done, the game should run successfully as expected.
