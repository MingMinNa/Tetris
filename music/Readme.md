## Reason for not uploading the music files
I've removed all the game music (except for DeleteLine.mp3) due to copyright issues. 

## How to play the game with your own music files
To ensure you get the full gaming experience, 
you'll need to find four mp3 files, place them in this folder(music folder), and rename them **"HomeState.mp3"**, **"GameState1.mp3"**, **"GameState2.mp3"**, **"GameState3.mp3"**, **~~"DeleteLine.mp3"~~**, respectively.  
Once done, the game should run successfully as expected.

## Note
If any of the mp3 files are missing, the game still works but without music.  
To fix the above, please check whether the file names are correct and the mp3 files exist.

I've uploaded the "DeleteLine.mp3" because I think music files like this are too hard to find.
